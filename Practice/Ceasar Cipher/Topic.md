# Topic_of_The_Project
This will be my first project in Golang after finishing the book and learning the basics.

Lately i took some interest in Cryptography and was studying it's history. I stumbeled upon the Ceasar Cypher a cryptography method created by julius ceasar himself.
the algorithm seems challenging enough without being too hard. so i thought it would be a perfect project to test my hold of Golang
