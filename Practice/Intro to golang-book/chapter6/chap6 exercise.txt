1. sum is a function that takes a slice of numbers and adds them together. What
would its function signature look like in Go?

    in golang, a function signature would be defined by its parameters and return type.
    and for function like sum the signature would look somthing like this:
        func sum(numbers []float64)float64{
            total := 0.0
            for _, value := range numbers{
                total += value
            }
            return total
        }
    added how would the full function would look like

2. Write a function that takes an integer and halves it and returns true if it was even
or false if it was odd. For example, half(1) should return (0, false) and
half(2) should return (1, true).

    Check the Ex2.go file

3. Write a function with one variadic parameter that finds the greatest number in a
list of numbers.

    check the Ex3.go file

4. Using makeEvenGenerator as an example, write a makeOddGenerator function
that generates odd numbers

    check the Ex4.go file

5. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as: fib(0) = 0, fib(1) = 1, fib(n) =
fib(n-1) + fib(n-2). Write a recursive function that can find fib(n).

    check the Ex5.go file

6. What are defer, panic, and recover? How do you recover from a runtime panic?

    defer is a staetment that make the function that declared after it to execute the last in a program. very useful in scenarios of opening and closing folder and making the code more readble, plus it will still run if panic occures
    Panic indicate a programmers error and recover helps in igonoring the error. in a way the combination of these 2 calls is very similar to cin.ignore() and cin.clear() calls in c++, cz they serve the same perpose of handling errors.

7. How do you get the memory address of a variable?

    using the & operator before a pointer variable

8. How do you assign a value to a pointer?

    assiginin a pointer is ez we first delcare the variable name add an "*" follwed with the variable type: i.e. num  *int64
    and to assigne it we should do somthing called derfrencing --> *num = 9

9. How do you create a new pointer?

    accidently answerd this question in the previous question number 8

10. What is the value of x after running this program:
    func square(x *float64) {
        *x = *x * *x
    }
    func main() {
        x := 1.5
        square(&x)
    }

        output --> 1.5 * 1.5 = 2.25

11. Write a program that can swap two integers (x := 1; y := 2; swap(&x, &y)
should give you x=2 and y=1).
