1. How are integers stored on a computer?

    integers are stored on a computers under the form of bytes. And in golang we have 
    types for each amount of bytes we may need for exampl:
    uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, int8, int16, int32, and int64
    as well as float32 and float64

2. We know that (in base 10) the largest one-digit number is 9 and the largest twodigit
number is 99. Given that in binary the largest two-digit number is 11 (3),
the largest three-digit number is 111 (7) and the largest four-digit number is 1111
(15), what’s the largest eight-digit number? (Hint: 101−1 = 9 and 102−1 = 99)

    3 digit: 2^3 - 1 = 7; 4 digit: 2^4 - 1 = 15; 8 digit: 2^8 - 1 = 255

3. Although overpowered for the task, you can use Go as a calculator. Write a program
that computes 32,132 × 42,452 and prints it to the terminal (use the * operator
for multiplication).

    Easy, check the Ex3.go file
    output --> 32132 * 42542 =  1366959544

4. What is a string? How do you find its length?

    A string is a data type that  is defined by enclosing characters between double quotes or backticks

5. What’s the value of the expression (true && false) || (false && true) || !
(false && false)?

    check the Ex5.go file
    output --> true
