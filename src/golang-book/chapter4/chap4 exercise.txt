1. What does the following program print?
    i := 10
    if i > 10 {
    fmt.Println("Big")
    } else {
    fmt.Println("Small")
    }

    output --> small (check Ex1.go)

2. Write a program that prints out all the numbers between 1 and 100 that are
evenly divisible by 3 (i.e., 3, 6, 9, etc.).

    check Ex2.go file

3. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of
three, print “Fizz” instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print
“Buzz.” For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print “FizzBuzz.”
