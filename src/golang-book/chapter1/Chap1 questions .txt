1. What is whitespace?
    any empty space such as new lines, spaces, tabs, etc. which like C/C++, Go does not regard.

2. What is a comment? What are the two ways of writing a comment?
    comment are lines of text, which the compiler disregard. it is the same C/C++ syntax,
    either after // or between /* */.

3.Our program began with package main. What would the files in the fmt package
begin with?
    every function from the pacakge "fmt" should start with fmt.<function>.
    for example: fmt.Println("text")

4. We used the Println function defined in the fmt package. If you wanted to use
the Exit function from the os package, what would you need to do?
    we import the package by writing, import "os". then we call the function by writing,
    os.Exit(). for further info about this function we can always use "go doc os Exit"
    on the terminal.

5. Modify the program we wrote so that instead of printing Hello, World it prints
Hello, my name is followed by your name.
    Done .( = w =).
