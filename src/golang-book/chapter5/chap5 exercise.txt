1. How do you access the fourth element of an array or slice?

    x := [5]int64{98, 93, 77, 82, 83}
    the fourth element in an array or slice is: x[3] = 82

2. What is the length of a slice created using make([]int, 3, 9)?

    the lenght of the slice is 3, and 9 is the lenght of the underlying array.

3. Given the following array, what would x[2:5] give you?
x := [6]string{"a","b","c","d","e","f"}

    it would give c d  e f 

Write a program that finds the smallest number in this list:
x := []int{
    48,96,86,68,
    57,82,63,70,
    37,34,83,27,
    19,97, 9,17,
}
